SubTask 1 Make the Arrow path unconditional
• Delete the zero_copy feature from Cargo.toml.
• Remove every #[cfg(feature = "zero_copy")] / #[cfg(not(feature = "zero_copy"))] block in RiffqProcessor::do_query, MyExtendedQueryHandler::do_query, and do_describe_portal.
• Keep only the branch that calls execute_arrow and arrow_to_pg_rows.
• Drop the old string-based code that fed DataRowEncoder with String values.
• cargo check must succeed.

SubTask 2 Unify the query-runner traits
• Change the existing QueryRunner trait so its execute method returns ArrowQueryResult instead of the string row type.
• Delete the temporary QueryRunnerArrow trait.
• Update DirectQueryRunner and RouterQueryRunner to implement the revised QueryRunner only.
• Replace every call to execute_arrow with execute.
• Delete the now unused execute_arrow implementations.
• Ensure all Arc<dyn QueryRunnerArrow> references become Arc<dyn QueryRunner>.
• Run cargo test and fix compile errors.

Subtask 3 Strip out the obsolete stringification helpers
• Remove the entire functions and any use lines for
arrow_value_to_string,
rows_to_record_batch,
record_batches_to_rows,
map_python_type_to_pgwire.
• Delete the “adjusted_desc” re-typing loops; Field::data_type is now the single source of truth.
• Make sure all remaining code that builds FieldInfo uses arrow_type_to_pgwire.
• Search the codebase for "_to_string" or adjusted_desc to confirm nothing lingers.
• cargo check again; repository must compile and unit tests must pass.
