# SubTask 1 Eliminate the “adjusted_desc” logic entirely
• Search the codebase for any variable named adjusted_desc or comment describing “type guessing”.
• Delete the loops that inspected string columns to infer int/float/bool.
• Ensure every place that builds FieldInfo now takes the data type directly from Schema::fields() and converts it with arrow_type_to_pgwire.
• cargo check and run integration tests.

# SubTask 2 Clean up remaining dead helpers and imports
• Run cargo +nightly udeps or manually grep for unused functions: arrow_value_to_string, map_python_type_to_pgwire, any rows_* helpers.
• Remove them along with redundant use lines.

# Subtask 3 Update docs and examples
• Revise README.md and any example code to note that zero-copy Arrow is now the default path; remove mention of the old string fallback.
• Add a short code snippet in examples/arrow_zero_copy.rs demonstrating a Python callback returning a PyCapsule.

# SubTask 4 Benchmark memory allocations before vs after
• Add a criterion benchmark in benches/zero_copy.rs that executes a Python callback returning one million-row, two-column integer table.
• Record total allocated bytes with criterion::profiler::Profiler.
• Compare current numbers to a tag taken before the refactor; target is at least 10× reduction in allocations.
• Commit the benchmark results in BENCH.md.

# Subtask 5 End-to-end verification with psql and JDBC
• Spin up the server at localhost:5433, run basic create-table and select queries from psql.
• Run the same queries from the PostgreSQL JDBC driver.
• Confirm result sets are correct and server stays up after large transfers.
