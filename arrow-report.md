# Arrow vs list[dict]

This report summarizes potential benefits and tradeoffs when using Apache Arrow to transfer query results between the Python layer and the Rust backend.

## Benefits
- **Zero-copy sharing**: Arrow allows sharing memory across languages without serialization overhead, which reduces CPU usage and latency.
- **Columnar layout**: Many analytics engines and libraries operate natively on columnar data; using Arrow keeps data in that form and enables vectorized execution.
- **Interoperability**: Arrow is a well supported standard with bindings for many languages, which makes it easier to integrate with other systems.

## Tradeâ€‘offs
- **Extra dependency**: Requires `pyarrow` on the Python side and an Arrow crate on the Rust side.
- **Complexity**: Handling the Arrow C Data Interface is more involved than simple Python lists.
- **Binary compatibility**: Arrow versions must be kept in sync between Python and Rust to avoid ABI mismatches.

Overall Arrow can provide better performance for large result sets but increases dependency and build complexity.
